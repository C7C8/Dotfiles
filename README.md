# Sourec Dotfiles (*Moloch*)

These files are my dotfiles for my own personal use. They are published here
so that others may use them as they wish. Note that
they are my own personal files, and as such contain personalized controls,
settings, and system-specific configurations. I offer no assistance in getting
these files to work -- if these files don't work for you, I expect you to know
how to make them work.

This branch's files are oriented towards what I have designated *Moloch*-grade
systems, or light laptops with little processing power. As such, there is an
emphasis on performance and power usage over asthetics. My naming convention
is based on the names of Shivan capital ships from the *Freespace 2* universe:
a *Moloch* is a light corvette, a *Sathanas* is a juggernaut, a *Ravana* is
a destroyer, etc.

## License Note
Not all files here are my own, and as such the license found in LICENSE.md (GPLv3) doesn't apply to those. For reference, those files are:

* i3/i3scripts/ (has its own README.md file explaining license, GPLv3)
* media/, although that might change eventually
* Images under modes/standby/
* scripts/vlcinfo
* soundboard/cymcrash.ogg
* vim/

If you verifiably own any of these files and are within the terms of your license to do so, feel free to raise an issue asking me to remove the file whose presence you object to.
