# Sourec Dotfiles

These files are my dotfiles for my own personal use. They are published here
so that others may use my files as they wish for their own purposes. Note that
they are my own personal files, and as such contain personalized controls,
settings, and system-specific configuration. I offer no assistance in getting
these files to work -- if these files don't work for you, I expect you to know
how to make them work.

## Requirements
* i3
* i3blocks
* Conky
* bspwm
* bspc
* sxhkd
* acpi

## Optional
These are referenced in i3/config, but are not necessary for functionality.
* i3lock
* PCManFM
* Synapse

## Installation 
I won't give full installation instructions here due to the variety of configurations
across systems (and admittedly my own unwillingness to do so), but here is a rough
listing of files I have symlinked to this Dotfiles folder. I expect that you'll know
where the appropriate links should go.

* bspwmrc
* sxhkdrc
* vim
* vimrc
* i3

## License Note
Not all files here are my own, and as such the license found in LICENSE.md (GPLv3) doesn't apply to those. For reference, those files are:

* i3/i3scripts/ (has its own README.md file explaining license, GPLv3)
* media/, although that might change eventually
* Images under modes/standby/
* scripts/vlcinfo
* soundboard/cymcrash.ogg
* vim/

If you verifiably own any of these files and are within the terms of your license to do so, feel free to raise an issue asking me to remove the file whose presence you object to.
