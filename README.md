# Sourec Dotfiles (*Sathanas*)

These are my dotfiles, sathanas-grade. That means
that they're designed to be used on a fast system with a full+
keyboard, not an ancient laptop like the other branch. Assume a
desktop build with a number pad and two screens.

These files can be installed using Dotrix, which will automatically
create all necessary symlinks (and whine if it can't). I've done my
best to ensure that all files here are of my own creation, but some
resources (e.g. images, desktop backgrounds) may not be my own. If
you verifiably own one of these files and object to its inclusion
here, feel free to send me an email or raise an issue on the issue tracker.

My naming convention is based on the names of Shivan capital ships 
from the *Freespace 2* universe: a *Moloch* is a light corvette, a 
*Sathanas* is a juggernaut, a *Ravana* is a destroyer, etc.

## Required Software

* Dotrix (installation only)
* Zsh
* Vim
* Termite
* BSPWM/SXHKD
* i3lock
* Git (obviously)

More will be added here soon, see the TODO file for information on
what future plans are.
