# Sourec Dotfiles (*Moloch2*)

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones
are mine. They're designed to be used on a fast system with a full+
keyboard, not an ancient laptop like the other branch. Assume a
desktop build with a number pad and two screens.

These files can be installed using Dotrix, which will automatically
create all necessary symlinks (and whine if it can't). I've done my
best to ensure that all files here are of my own creation, but some
resources (e.g. images, desktop backgrounds) may not be my own. If
you verifiably own one of these files and object to its inclusion
here, feel free to send me an email or raise an issue on the issue tracker.

My naming convention is based on the names of Shivan capital ships 
from the *Freespace 2* universe: a *Moloch* is a light corvette, a 
*Sathanas* is a juggernaut, a *Ravana* is a destroyer, etc. These files
are based on the *Sathanas* branch files, but with reduced complexity and
monitor count, to allow for usage on a laptop.

## Required Software

These programs are REQUIRED for the system to run as expected. If you
don't have one of them, you're going to have some problems.

* Dotrix (installation only)
* Zsh
* Termite
* bspwm
* sxhkd
* i3lock-color (the new version, i3lock-color-git)
* Git (obviously)
* Polybar
* Compton
* Feh
* Conky
* hddtemp (make sure to get your permissions right!)
* curl
* rofi
* python-dateutil

## Optional Software

These programs are not strictly required, but they are mentioned in 
few places. They likely won't cause any problems if not installed, but
I haven't tested it, so I wouldn't know. These are mostly my own
personal choices for daily programs.

* Telegram
* Thunderbird
* Gnome Control Center (I use it for wireless management only, since it handles wireless better than most. Sue me.)
* Pavucontrol
* pcmanfm
* Vim/GVim
